# E-Commerce Transaction Value Prediction

This project uses machine learning algorithms to **classify e-commerce transactions as either high-valued or low-valued**.

## Project Overview
The goal is to help e-commerce platforms **predict the potential value of a transaction** using historical data. This can aid in targeted marketing, fraud detection, or resource allocation.

## Algorithms Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Both models are trained and compared to determine which performs better on this classification task.

## Features Considered (Example)
- Customer demographics (age, gender, location)
- Product details (category, price, discount)
- Purchase history

_The exact features may vary depending on the dataset._
